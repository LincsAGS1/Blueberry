Bugs:
- The bin seems to overlap with the Computer desk quite often, 
  the bed also overlapped with the computer desk in some games too, but it's much less often.

- The objects can sometimes spawn halfway out of the room as half of the bed wan in the room and the other half
  outside, this only happened when the bed spawned horizontally at the bottom of the room.


- You can push the AI out of the areana with a player character if they are near the walls, 
  this only happens if you push them from behind when they are facing the wall 
  (doesn't work if you hit them from the side).

- Players seems to die before the health drains, they seem to die after about 5-7 seconds with the virus
  while the health seems around 95% full 
  (Actually they stretch quite wide and get teleported out of the arena and they are still controllable and can
   be breifly seen in the game if they get close to the arena).

- After around 3-4 min an uninfected fire engine which was in the top left corner for the entire game, turned
  and went to the bottom left corner which had an infected AI and another AI stuck there until it hit the infected AI
  and then stayed in the bottom left corner with the 2 other AI, only had this happen once.

- The speed up power up isn't collectable and acts like an obstacle.

- When an infected and normal AI is in a corner together continuously colliding, the infection doesn't pass on between 
  the two AI, this happens quite often as the AI seem to head to the same corners.

- An AI can pass off the virus to a blueberry curing themselves.

- Sometimes the players cannot give the virus to AI, this maybe due to the invincibility 
  (Though the player doesn't get stunned when they get the virus like the AI).



Not bugs but issues that can cause problems:
- In the bedroom objects can spawn in such a way that locks out a portion of the bedroom
  while leaving another area object free, this happens quite frequantly and the AI /players can spawn in the
  segregated areas making the game unbeatable.

- The game doesn't scale with the aspect ratio, meaning parts of the screen get cut out at certion resolutions
  (Note the UI does anchor it self somewhat to positions on the screen but the size of the UI does not scale
   so at small resolutions the UI obscures most of the screen).

- Power ups are incredably small and appear to disappear too quickly, also they seem to spawn a bit to infrequent.

- A power up seems to use the exact same sprite as the taxi AI, maybe put a glow on it to differentiate it from
  the taxi AI, or put a glow on all the power ups so they stick out more.

- The UI is hard to see against some objects, maybe add a background for the entire UI so it's visable against
  all surfaces.

- Enemies take too long to die.

- AI do not go around objects.

- Player has a bigger collision box so AI can get in small crevices that the player cannot making the game
  unbeatable if this situation occures.

- The blueberry AI seem to run away from the infected players when they should take no notice.

- Game doesn't end when everything is a blueberry/dead (Though player 2 had health left this could be the problem,
  time/score didn't stop either. Maybe have a pop-up menu after the game is won/lost with options to restart or continue).

- The AI health can go off screen if the enemy is at the top of the screen.

- The "invincible" power-up doesn't seem to have an effect or the effect is too short (as in under 2 seconds),
  I picked up the power up and 2 seconds later hit an infected player, I got the virus and my health ticked down
  as normal.  

- Maybe have a small timer/bar showing how long the AI/player are stunned/invincible for as it's a bit ambigous.
